A modification of the embedly module to allow for non-linked pictures.

When added, will create a field called 'Thumbnail URL'. This is a url to a picture, or theoretically video, somewhere. Upon doing this, it will override any picture added by the embedly module via the linked 'URL' link. This means that you can create a thumbnail without linking to a website, or you can link to a website but chose a different picture. If no link is placed in the 'Thumbnail URL' field, the embedly module will populate the picture as normal.


Please note that while this works fine, it may be a little hacked together, and thus may be inconsistent if extended.
